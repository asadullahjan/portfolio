Mr Hydrate Me is a mobile app designed to help users track and manage daily water intake. It personalizes hydration goals based on the user’s age, weight, and local weather conditions, and adjusts these goals dynamically.

### Key Features

- **Personalized Hydration Goals**: Calculates daily intake targets based on user age, weight, and real-time weather data.
- **Weather-Based Adjustments**: Modifies recommendations depending on temperature and humidity.
- **Reminders**: Customizable push notifications to remind users to drink water at preferred intervals.
- **Quick Add Options**: Predefined buttons for 250ml, 500ml, and 1L water amounts, plus a custom input option.
- **Hydration History**: Tracks past intake and supports streaks and achievements for consistency.
- **Visual Progress**: Uses `react-native-gifted-charts` to show animated charts of daily water intake.
- **Form Validation**: Validates user input with `react-hook-form` to ensure accurate data entry.
- **Firebase Integration**: Stores user data securely for cross-device syncing and persistence.

### Problem Solved

Many people either forget to stay hydrated or consume too much water. Mr Hydrate Me addresses this by:

- Tracking exact water intake and helping users hit—not exceed—their hydration targets.
- Adjusting daily goals based on both personal metrics and changing weather conditions.
- Encouraging healthy hydration habits with progress feedback, notifications, and reward streaks.
