An interactive music visualizer built with **p5.js**, showcasing real-time audio-reactive animations using **FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)** and waveform analysis. This project transforms music into engaging visuals across multiple unique modes.

‚ö†Ô∏è The last two animations are resource-heavy and may cause performance issues.

## Key Features

- **3D Box Visuals**: Animations react dynamically to bass and treble frequencies
- **Multiple Modes**: Includes polygon, tree, needle, and waveform-based visualizations
- **Audio Analysis**: Real-time frequency spectrum and waveform rendering
- **Interactive UI**: Music controls and mode toggling for a personalized experience
- **Modular Design**: Easily extensible codebase for adding new effects
