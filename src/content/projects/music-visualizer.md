## Overview

A dynamic music visualizer built with p5.js that features multiple interactive and audio-reactive animations. The project demonstrates the use of FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) and waveform analysis to visualize music in real-time.

## Key Features

- 3D box animation that responds to bass and treble
- Polygon, tree, and needle visualizations
- Frequency spectrum and waveform graphs
- Toggle between different modes for unique effects
- Interactive design with music controls and modular visuals
