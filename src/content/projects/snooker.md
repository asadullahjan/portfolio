## Overview

This snooker simulation was built using Matter.js to explore physics-based gameplay. It includes realistic ball dynamics, collision detection, and custom table design with rounded corners and interactive cushions.

## Key Features

- Physics-based ball movement with collision
- Rounded table corners using custom vertices
- Pockets and cushions crafted with Matter.js's `fromVertices` feature
- Disabled gravity for accurate table simulation
- Organized and modular code structure for easier future updates
