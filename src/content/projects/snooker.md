### Key Features

- **Realistic Physics**  
  Balls move and collide using accurate physics-based calculations powered by Matter.js.

- **Rounded Table Corners**  
  Custom-shaped table with rounded corners for enhanced realism and better ball deflection.

- **Functional Cushions and Pockets**  
  Carefully crafted cushions and pockets replicate authentic snooker gameplay, allowing for realistic bank shots and potting.

- **Game State Persistence**  
  Players can leave mid-game and return later, resuming from where they left off.

- **Single and Multiplayer Support**  
  Play solo or take turns in a two-player match mode.

- **Optimized Code Structure**  
  Organized into modular sections for easy updates, customization, and potential expansion.

This simulation offers an engaging way to explore the mechanics of snooker and the capabilities of 2D physics engines in interactive browser games.
