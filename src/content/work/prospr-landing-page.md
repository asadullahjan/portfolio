Prospr is a team scheduling platform designed to streamline team coordination and optimize scheduling workflows. I played a key role in the development of the platform, focusing on front-end development and ensuring a seamless user experience.

### My Contributions

- **Pixel-Perfect Design Conversion**: Converted Figma designs into responsive, pixel-perfect layouts, ensuring a visually consistent and professional experience across all devices.
- **Animations**: Implemented animations across all pages except the main and about pages, using GSAP to bring smooth transitions and interactive elements to life.
- **Team Collaboration with Jera**: Used Jera for team collaboration, task tracking, and efficient project workflow throughout development.

### Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, TailwindCSS
- **Animation Libraries**: GSAP
- **Team Collaboration**: Jera

This project sharpened my skills in building polished UIs, integrating animations at scale, and collaborating effectively in a fast-moving team environment.
