Jobr.pro is a full-featured job application automation platform built to save users time and improve the quality of their job hunt. As part of a 3–4 person development team, I contributed to both frontend and backend components, working on features that integrate AI tools and automation into a clean, user-friendly experience.

### Key Features

- **Resume Review Tool**: Built a user interface for resume analysis, highlighting potential improvements using AI feedback.
- **Cover Letter Generator**: Integrated a custom AI-driven system for generating tailored cover letters based on job descriptions and resumes.
- **Job Board Integration**: Enabled users to import job listings from job boards like LinkedIn and Indeed and track them on the Jobr dashboard.
- **SEO-Optimized Job Pages**: Improved visibility of job listings by generating dynamic, SEO-friendly job detail pages using Next.js routing and metadata handling.
- **User Dashboard**: Helped implement a dashboard where users can manage job submissions, documents, and AI tool results.
- **Social Share Tools**: Built utilities to generate shareable content (text + image) for advertising job pages on platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn.

### My Role

During my time on the team (Jan 2024 – Dec 2024), I worked extensively across the stack and led key features:

- **Created the Jobr Extension**:

  - Implemented auto-fill for job application forms on supported job boards by reverse-engineering their structure.
  - Added a "submit in background" feature using direct API calls for some platforms — though experimental, it still worked reliably.
  - Allowed users to save job listings from boards like LinkedIn and Indeed into their Jobr dashboard.

- **Developed Major Features**:

  - Built the **cover letter generator**, integrating resume and job data into custom prompts for the AI model.

  - Created the **job detail page** system with SEO-optimized dynamic routing.

  - Built the **social media content generator** that outputs both text and image posts for easy promotion.

    <ImageGallery images={[ { src: '/assets/jobr-pro/jobr-6.png', alt: 'Jobr post generator' }, { src: '/assets/jobr-pro/jobr-7.png', alt: 'Jobr post generator' }]}/>

- Collaborated closely on **frontend UI/UX**, feature planning, and code reviews.

This project helped me grow as a full-stack developer, especially in **Next.js**, **Node.js**, and browser automation — and gave me deep insight into reverse engineering, form automation, and AI-assisted tooling.

### Technologies

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Redis, Firebase
- **Automation & Extensions**: Puppeteer, Playwright, Chrome Debugger API
- **DevOps**: Vercel, GitHub Actions
