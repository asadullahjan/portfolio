## Background

I'm Asadullah Jan, a Full-Stack Developer based in Islamabad, Pakistan, with 1.5 years of industry experience. I specialize in building responsive web apps, browser extensions, and automation tools using modern stacks like React, Node.js, and Next.js.

Throughout my career, I've contributed to impactful products, including an AI-driven job automation platform that streamlines hiring processes. I thrive in agile, fast-paced teams, where I focus on delivering scalable features, clean integrations with third-party APIs, and intuitive user experiences.

> ###### **I don't just build features — I take them all the way to production.**

That means ensuring everything I ship is fully integrated, tested, and working reliably in real-world environments.

Currently, I'm pursuing a BSc in Computer Science at Goldsmiths, University of London, while continuing to ship production-level code and gain hands-on experience from startup ecosystems.

I'm fluent in English, Urdu/Hindi, and a native Pashto speaker. This allows me to communicate effectively across teams and cultures.

Outside of work, I enjoy running, cycling, and gaming.

I'm always open to full-time opportunities where I can build, learn, and make a meaningful impact.
